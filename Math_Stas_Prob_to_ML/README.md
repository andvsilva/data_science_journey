## Essential Linear Algebra and Calculus Hands-On in NumPy, TensorFlow, and PyTorch

- [ML foundation github](https://github.com/jonkrohn/ML-foundations/tree/master)

### What you'll learn

- Understand the fundamentals of linear algebra and calculus, critical mathematical
  subjects underlying all of machine learning and data science
- Manipulate tensors using all three of the most important Python tensor libraries: 
  NumPy, TensorFlow, and PyTorch
- How to apply all of the essential vector and matrix operations for machine learning 
  and data science
- Reduce the dimensionality of complex data to the most informative elements with 
  eigenvectors, SVD, and PCA
- Solve for unknowns with both simple techniques (e.g., elimination) and advanced 
  techniques (e.g., pseudoinversion)
- Appreciate how calculus works, from first principles, via interactive code demos 
  in Python
- Intimately understand advanced differentiation rules like the chain rule
- Compute the partial derivatives of machine-learning cost functions by hand as well 
  as with TensorFlow and PyTorch
- Grasp exactly what gradients are and appreciate why they are essential for enabling 
  ML via gradient descent
- Use integral calculus to determine the area under any given curve
- Be able to more intimately grasp the details of cutting-edge machine learning papers
- Develop an understanding of what's going on beneath the hood of machine learning
  algorithms, including those used for deep learning


### Description

Mathematics forms the core of data science and machine learning. Thus, to be the best 
data scientist you can be, you must have a working understanding of the most relevant 
math.

Getting started in data science is easy thanks to high-level libraries like Scikit-learn 
and Keras. But understanding the math behind the algorithms in these libraries opens an 
infinite number of possibilities up to you. From identifying modeling issues to inventing
new and more powerful solutions, understanding the math behind it all can dramatically 
increase the impact you can make over the course of your career.

Led by deep learning guru Dr. Jon Krohn, this course provides a firm grasp of the 
mathematics — namely linear algebra and calculus — that underlies machine learning 
algorithms and data science models.



### Course Sections

- Linear Algebra Data Structures
- Tensor Operations
- Matrix Properties
- Eigenvectors and Eigenvalues
- Matrix Operations for Machine Learning
- Limits
- Derivatives and Differentiation
- Automatic Differentiation
- Partial-Derivative Calculus
- Integral Calculus

Throughout each of the sections, you'll find plenty of hands-on assignments, Python 
code demos, and practical exercises to get your math game in top form!

This Mathematical Foundations of Machine Learning course is complete, but in the 
future, we intend on adding extra content from related subjects beyond math, namely: 
probability, statistics, data structures, algorithms, and optimization. Enrollment 
now includes free, unlimited access to all of this future course content — over 
25 hours in total.
