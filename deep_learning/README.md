### Deep Learning

A subset of machine learning, or deep learning, is basically a three-layer neural network. By simulating human brain function, although not exactly mimicking it, these neural networks enable the human brain to "learn" from vast quantities of data.

Deep learning is unique in that it can automatically find complex representations and patterns in data, frequently without the need for explicit programming. Deep learning algorithms—particularly deep neural networks—have demonstrated impressive performance across a range of tasks, including speech recognition, picture identification, and natural language processing.

Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) for sequential data, transformers for tasks like language modeling and translation, and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for image-related tasks are some common deep learning designs. These deep neural networks are often trained using methods like stochastic gradient descent and backpropagation, which involve changing the parameters of the network to reduce the discrepancy between expected and observed outputs.

### Neural Networks

Neural networks, like those found in the human brain, are computational models whose architecture and operation are modeled after biological neural networks. It is made up of layers of linked nodes, or neurons. After processing incoming data, each neuron generates an output signal.
