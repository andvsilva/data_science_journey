## Solving A Simple Regression Problem To Understand How Deep Learning Model Improve Along The Way

In this paper, I will create a simple problem (***Linear Regression - Line***) to be solve by deep learning model and to study how we can improve the model, by adding input layers, hidden layers, neurons and output layers. This approach allow us to understand deep learning along the way.

To start, the first question is:

#### What is Deep Learning?

#### Defining The Problem

#### Splitting The Data: Train and Test

#### Deep Learning Model - Baseline

#### From Results Can We Improve the Baseline Model?

#### Adding New Features To Model

#### After Improving The Model, We Get Better Results?
