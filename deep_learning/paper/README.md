### Solving A Simple Regression Problem To Understand How Deep Learning Model Can Improve Along The Way

In this paper, I will create a simple problem (***Linear Regression***) to be solve by deep learning model and to study how we can improve the model, by adding input layers, hidden layers, neurons and output layers, from a baseline model architecture.

To start, the first question is:

#### What is Deep Learning?

#### Defining The Problem

#### Splitting The Data: Train and Test

#### Deep Learning Model - Baseline

#### From Results Can We Improve the Baseline Model?

#### Adding New Features To Model

#### After Improving The Model, We Get Better Results?
