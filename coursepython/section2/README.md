## Introduction to Python programming language:

- Python is a high-level, interpreted, general-purpose programming language.

- Its design emphasises code readability through the use of significant indentation.

- Python is dynamically typed and garbage-collected.

- A high-level programming language is one that abstracts the details of the computer.

- When writing a program using any programming language, all code written is converted into machine code, which is binary 0s and 1s.

- However, for programmers, writing a program using machine code is extremely difficult since a computer's processor can only process machine code.

- Programmers who used to code in machine code did not use 0s and 1s.

- Instead, they wrote code in a more readable format, such as decimal, octal, or hexadecimal.

- This code was then translated into an internal format by a program called a loader.

- Back in the early days, programming a computer using machine code was quite difficult.

- To reduce this difficulty, assembly language was introduced, which provided one abstraction level on top of machine code.

- Unlike binary code, assembly code had some human-readable symbols, numerics, strings, etc.

- In assembly code, we had to directly work with hardware features of the processor, i.e., its registers.

- Writing code in assembly language was still difficult, so another layer of abstraction was added on top of it.

- A more human-readable language, like the C programming language, was introduced to make coding easier.


## What is a general purpose programming language?

- A general-purpose programming language is a language that can be used to develop software for a wide range of application domains.

- Python is a GPL that can be used to write desktop software, web applications, data science, ML, etc.

- In contrast to general-purpose programming languages, we also have domain-specific programming languages, such as SQL.

- DSLs are used within a specific area, such as SQL, which can only be used for querying relational databases and nothing else.

## Emphasises code readability

- Code readability refers to how easy it is for a human to read and comprehend code.

- Python is a programming language that places special importance on code readability and is one of the most readable programming languages.

- Code readability is important because if code is readable, more people will be able to use it and it will be easier to maintain.

- Another reason why code readability is important is that as a programmer, you will spend most of your time reading, understanding, reusing, and modifying existing source code.

## Uses significant indentation

- Indentation refers to having space at the beginning of a line of code.

- Indentation makes code more readable, but in programming languages like C, C++, and Java, indentation is only used for code readability and formatting.

- In Python, indentation is part of the syntax and is used to indicate a block of code.

- For example, in Java, we use curly braces to represent a block of code, whereas in Python, we use indentation, i.e., spaces to indicate a block of code.

## Python is dynamically typed

- In programming languages like C, when you declare a variable, you also set the type for that variable, and the type of that variable cannot be changed during execution.

- In Python, you do not have to declare the type while creating a variable.

- Due to dynamic typing, a variable can have a different type at different times during execution.

- In dynamic typing, the type of variable is decided at runtime.

## Python is garbage collected
  
- Garbage collection is a process of automatic memory management.

- In Python, we do not have to worry about freeing up or reclaiming allocated and unused memory because it is garbage collected.

- Garbage collection automatically reclaims memory that was allocated by the program but is no longer in use.

- As programmers, we do not have to manually deallocate memory.
