# An√°lise de Sentimentos com Language Studio no Azure AI

Passo a passo - Lab.

## Get started with Speech

[What is speech to text?](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/speech-service/speech-to-text)

[Sample Repository for the Microsoft Cognitive Services Speech SDK](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/cognitive-services-speech-sdk)

```bash
You can't rush storing information in your long term
memory. It takes time and repetition and this is a tactic 
called spaced repetition. So space repetition involves 
learning something and then after a period of time 
going back and reviewing it, or even better, actively recalling 
this information or learning curve, or better yet, labeled. 
Our forgetting curve is very steep initially. 
When learning something, however, we go back and actually retrieve it or review it. 
This curve actually levels out. So how did I actually implement this? At 
the time I was going to school and also working, so my only free time to 
learn Python was in the evenings. So for this I focused an hour to two a 
day at minimum to learn and study Python.
