have you ever been in a group conversation where everyone else is talking and laughing and you're just sitting there silence it's almost like you're stuck in this bad dream or your mouth won't open do you want to contribute to the conversation but it just it doesn't happen you start to panic and you start to wonder will I ever belong yeah that was me I remember one time I was with my friends the homie Dave and we met up with these other guys he knew them I did not but we went over to one of their Apartments to pregame and it was like immediately I felt inferior to these other guys because they were there laughing telling stories and I was in the corner you know sipping on my drink waiting for my opportunity which never came and then of course later that night when we were out at the bars talking to girls I just deferred to them like I felt like they deserve the girls I didn't deserve them man so I watched as they got phone numbers and that night actually a couple of the dudes brought home some girls that were really attractive and all I could do was just witness it and feel like shit about myself but then there was a moment when I realized that my introversion that wasn't the problem it was just the way I was using it and since then I've adapted and learned how to flip that silence into power now real quick before we hop in if you're a man who's looking to finish 2024

days this is by far the biggest deal of the year and it is this week only description or go to gamestop.comhow many days ago I was in a group was like three guys three girls and someone brought it up they say yo you guys see that that Jake Paul fight by the way what I do now in the past I would wait for my opportunity to be like the third person to give my opinion what I do now is I steal the frame and I make sure that I'm the first person to introduces my opinion I said look I think it was a pretty shity fight to me it seemed like Mike Tyson was completely gassed after two or three rounds but Jake Paul decided to take it easy on him and not knock him out what do you guys think and this is so powerful because the positions you as the leader and it forces everybody else to consider your input and then after that I can just sit back and silence and watch as the crowd reacts to me and in this case some people disagree with me actually and they thought Mike Tyson was the one who took it easy on Jake because there was this training video of Mike Tyson you know hitting the Pats really good for like 15 seconds but the point is I did not have to talk a lot yet I was still in the power position and I know something else I think but David is still going to be really hard to put myself out there like that and it is but it's still far easier than sitting and waiting for the opportunity to come and as far more powerful as well number two you're so chili is a weapon so there's this myth that actually it's probably true the myth is that extraverts get their energy from being around other people introverts we get our energy from being alone and I say it's true because when I'm alone filmed in a video like this or you know editing a video on my laptop or working out at the gym that is the environments in which I feel like I have a lot of energy and I can just keep going and going and going but I have to show upit was social events and socialize with other people it's almost like you know when video games is like a health bar and as you get attacked it's slowly depletes that's how I feel like when I got to talk to other people and make small talk like my health bars slowly depleting and then I get to some point where I'm like fuck this I don't want to be here how do I get out of here and of course that always made me feel like I had this massive disadvantage versus other guys when it came to meeting new people and talking to girls but that is that's no longer the case here's why you see now when I'm about to enter a conversation or go to a party my mindset is I'm not going to be there for hours and hours I only have until my health bar depletes but in those 30 minutes that I'm there in those 30 minutes I'm talking to that person I'm going to make an impact and leave a very memorable impression on them like bro you got to realize that people are going to remember at the quality of the experience they had with you not the quantity girls aren't going to be chasing you because he was able to talk to me for 17 hours straight I mean maybe in the bedroom you want a little bit of quantity in addition to the quality but we're talking about social conversations here now man of course a girl's gonna be far more excited to see you again if she had this amazing five minute conversation with you and then you had to leave does mystery there's Intrigue this excitement there so the strategy is this before I answer a situation or a conversation I have a very specific and manageable golden my minds and once that's achieved I have permission to leave if I'm going to a wedding or something because there's a certain person I want to see I'm going to make sure that I have 20-30 minutes to solid conversation with that person then I'm gone there's nohow old is no need to stay around just to stay around that's not weak if you're going out with the intentions of meeting women what is your goal maybe you got to start a conversation with five girls and after that you're free to go home the fact is that we don't have unlimited social energy but we do get to choose how we use it number three really bro right now hey what's going on man a midfielder video yeah I already told them about that oh shit no no I forgot thank you bro I'll call you back so thankfully man thank God he calls I forgot to tell you there's another Black Friday

of the calm leader so I want you to close your eyes and picture a leader seriously I see something you didn't close your eyes yet close your eyes and picture a leader what comes to mind maybe it's someone like Donald Trump or the main guy in 300 they're loud they're proud they command attention and a lot of leaders are like that but not all of them what about Maximus and Gladiator which way I'm super hyped up because Gladiator two comes out later this week he's calm he's quiet yet he's still commands everybody's respect and I know you're probably thinking yeah I'd love to be like Maximus or Batman or John Wick that kind of feels like it's just these Sigma male archetypes in the movies how do I use it even possible for me to command that type of leadership role while being silent well here is a very specific strategy I utilize to make this happen so you see as introverts we have a natural calmness and we can leverage that to lead in subtle ways so if you're in a group scenario a meeting at work or with friends a lot of times people you know argue that they discussed different decisions and options so what I'll do is at the ends I'll be the one who kind of summarizes what's been said and then suggests the best plan so maybe with your buddies and everyone's arguing about what you're going to do this weekend at the end I would just say all right so you know what everyone's saying I think probably the best plan here is going to be that we start right now by hitting the gym getting that workout in getting that out of the way that we can go to that taco place you were talking about after that let's make thereservation for like 8:30 p.m. tonight because then we'll have a little time to chill beforehand and I think afterwards we can kind of figure out what we want to do does that sound good it's kind of like with Jake Paul we were talking about starting with an authoritative statement that sets the tone this is the opposite of that this is being the one who ends the discussion neither of these things require me to be like competing for the attention and looking for my opportunity in the middle of the battle the middle of the conversation sometimes I see you that's just when we're a bit more shy and quiet though right kind of like taking the opportunity at the beginning letting the noise happen and taking the opportunity at the end number 4 develop a silence so when it comes to the social game usually we think the one that's best with their words is the leader in Wheels the most power but during every conversation there's also a silence power game that is happening depending on your body language and I'm not just talking about you know holding strong eye contact and standing up tall those things are important but they're not going to change the game look the same way someone can make a very powerful or controversial statement as a power move while I learned that the same thing can be done silently with no words at all ready I'll tell you two ways that I like to do this the first one is during tense moments and conversation where someone challenges you or disrespect you or maybe a girl gives you a shit test I'm on a first date and I tell the girl and I don't really like going out of partying and she says oh you don't like to party that's no fun what I'll do in these moments automatically now is ado I contact take a deep breath lean back or sit back into my seat intentionally pause for 3 to 5 seconds and if the other person doesn't feel the silence I'll respond slowly and precisely even if I don't know what I'm saying so in this case I might say no I don't like to party and fucking works like magic bro because whenever someone is stepping to you they're expecting a reaction even if they don't know it the same way that if I'm confronting someone else or I'm trying to get under their skin I want to reaction and when you give this reaction or this lack of reaction it immediately makes the other person think like okay I'm not going to say something like that to him again because this just got really weird for me let's avoid that he clearly knows how to deal with this shit and the funny thing is I used to dread these moments and they don't have to happen in every conversation but now I actually look forward to them as big opportunities to stand out and you should too and my second go to silent power move is just physically greeting people if I meet a guy it's either going to be a handshake if it's more casual environment it's going to be adapt you know you slap the hand and shake the hand and if it's a girl I'm always going to go in with the warm hug even if I'm not sure even if it's like oh I know I met her boy friend is it weird if I hug her know I'm just always going to start with a physical introduction because immediately that creates this it shows a lack of fear and it creates a warm sensation between you and the person you're talking to so I'll do 100% of the time number five haveplay Exit Plan so we talked about using social energy is like this targeted weapon and that works it works really well however it still feels awkward when it comes time to leave like if I'm leaving a party early and I got to say bye to people and maybe I should just like sneak out the back door or some shit you know I don't want to be the guy who's who was too tired and went home early so it helps to have a strategy before you go in so you already know in your head I got a plan to leave and leave like a boss and leave with confidence it's like the goat Kanye West said this party ain't got hoes my intro is my outro he was not apologize for that I would show my strategy here is actually very straightforward rather than trying to not make a big deal about leaving I'm going to let people know I'm leaving with conviction and I'm going to own it so when it comes time for me to leave and I've made you know my three approaches for the night or whatever it is I'm just going to go up to each person that I feel I have some responsibility to talk to and just say you know hey man or hey girl it was good seeing you tonight I actually got to head out you know I got a busy day tomorrow but I hope you enjoy the rest of the night the mistake we tend to make is we like to leave a little bit of room for them to convince us to stay and it's like you know I was thinking maybe maybe I had home soon and you almost like looking at them for approval the key is just to come in like a boss and just tell them as a statement and to be honest people aren't used to that people aren't used to someone coming really quickly and then leaving with authority like that and it leaves people being a little bit you know curious about you who is this guy who you know who onlycame through for a quick hot minute and then left like a boss and that's basically the introvert game you got to build a tool kit you know no longer do I feel this generalized anxiety that I'm not going to have the opportunity to tell a badass story and those guys are better than me because they got better stories than me it's like nah man fuck that I have these different strategies I Implement them and I know that they work and then I can just own be in the silent leader the silent boss which I know doesn't come through on YouTube people are always like are you really a silent type of guy man broke on YouTube these would be the most boring I would never have a chance now if you're serious about becoming that type of guy first of all don't forget the Black Friday sales but second you need to watch this video next because in addition to these strategies there's also mistakes you need to avoid this video is about six social mistakes that make you look insecure click there to watch that now and I will talk to you in the next video Stay beastly
