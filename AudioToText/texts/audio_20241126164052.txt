if and when I have a son these will be 15 laws that I will pass down to him and hope that he will live by because bro over the last 10 years I've been on this journey of self-improvement and I've had to fight for every ounce of growth that I've realized with my finances my dating life my body with my mindset and during those 10 years which is a long time I had to go through so much failure rejection embarrassment self-doubt and that's why created these laws these will allow you and hopefully my future child to reach your goals and far less time than it took me with far less pain and make sure you watch all the way to the end because if you mess up even to one of these things is going to completely fuk up all of your progress number one a bad truth is better than a convenient lie we only lie when we are afraid when we're afraid that telling the truth will lead to a negative outcome so for example let's say that you cheat on your girlfriends now you have a decision to make do you tell her the truth and risk that she breaks up with you or do you lie to her and hope that she never finds out and that everything stays smooth sailing and of course you're never going to do it again right now I've never cheated but I did want to lie to someone recently because my friend asked me if I could go on his friends new podcast and I wanted to lie and say I'm a bit busy now but you know maybe next month when the reality is I don't want to do this guy's podcast I'm never going to do it I don't know him but you know I didn't want to be a dick and make things awkward so what I did was I told him the truth anyway I said look you know I really don't feel like doing your friends podcast from being honest because here's the thing when you lie to someone now going forward into the future you have to keep up with this false reality you're always going to be afraid that your girlfriend's gonna find out that's going to givewaiting for the next month but this guy to hit me up again and be like how about this month can you come on my podcast now lying to someone will always rob you of your peace of mind it's better to lose the girl or lose the friends but it happens because of something that's true and it's real you'll never regret that number two problems are a feature not a bug so question for you bro right now in your life what is stressing you out maybe for you it's your finances or maybe you have this weird family situation going on you have to deal with you have a health issue you're going through or you're getting sick and tired of getting no attention from females for me right now I'm just feeling overwhelmed bro we just move back internationally to the states and we've had some travel since then I've had so much work pile up that I'm trying to get through this week and every day I just wake up feeling like like I'm fucking drowning and in these moments of weakness we allowed to stress to Consumers and we start telling ourselves that if I could just have a girlfriend if I could just have enough money to stop worrying if I could just have all this work done this week that I could finally be happy and relaxed stop lying to yourself bro that is not how life Works your life is literally never ever ever going to be free of problems and guess what and that's my fuck with you a little bit but the more you try and do the more that you're going to expose yourself to more problems right now if you're single and you're just working a job for someone else guess what you have relatively low problems in your life versus if you're dating a girl friend and you're running your own business that's a lot more exposure for shit to go wrong now your girl is bitching at you because you're working too hard and not giving you enough attention and you're working so hard because you have to fire someone who completely fuk up and lost your company 20,000 dollarsplay last week I'm not I'm not trying to stress you out bro the point is that you need to start to look at your problems as challenges like a video game whatever is in front of you right now that's your current challenge once you beat that you're just going to get to the next level and face the next challenge number three confidence is not in your head right now it is literally impossible for me not to feel confident and I'm not saying that to be cocky like I'm the shit man I'm always confident I'm saying that because over the last 10 years I've built up the proof I've built this YouTube channel from 0 subscribers to over 1.6 million that was hard I didn't think I could do that shit I went from being a little lonely pathetic symptoms of women in finally marrying my dream girl despite having to go through a bunch of fucking rejection and embarrassing things I've built three businesses from zero to over 7 year and the fourth one was almost there too so now it's not about hyping myself up I'm confident I'm the shit I've just proven to myself time and time again that I can do things that I didn't think were possible to do and that's how real confidence comes and this means that you must to get started right now before you feel ready because if you're waiting to feel confident before you start approaching girls are you waiting to you feel prepared before you start that first side hustle guess what that moment is not going to come because you haven't done these things you haven't conquered these challenges yet you are going to doubt yourself you're going to overthink every fucking step you have to take do it anyway the confidence will come later number four the fastest decision maker wins so if you think about it life is really just a series of decisions that you make one after the next and this means that if you get stuck on a certain decisionyour postponing your life your postponing your growth so for example last week I was talking to the Beast Nation guys and one of them is facing this huge life decision and he's been putting it off for months unable to pull the trigger on one hand he could choose to start pursuing his passion for making music and do that when he gets home from work or on the other hand you can take that time and put it towards getting the next certification he needs to get his next promotion at work but he doesn't have time for both now obviously if he pursues making music he's not going to make more money but he's going to be able to enjoy his time doing something that he loves if he goes for the promotion it's not going to be as fun but he is going to make more money sooner but if you can continue to sit on the fence and do nothing while he's not making more money and he's also not pursuing his passion it's a lose-lose so next time you're facing a tough decision realize that it's a tough decision by definition because both options have value there's no wrong answer the only way you fail is by not committing to a decision in the first place number five alone you are fucked fucked Bro Fuck so I want to share something with you and that is that in my life I have never faced a single fear I've never confronted something that I'm deeply afraid of until I found another man who was also working towards that same outcome you know with women I wanted to start talking to girls and putting myself out there for years for years I was afraid to do it I only did it once I realized that my cousin Matt who you all have seen in the videos he was also working towards the same fear that we'd start going out together starting conversations with girls and everything went up from there baby I couldn't do it alone with YouTube I want to do YouTube for years but I was so afraid to put my face out there have other people judge me it's going to be so embarrassingI only took the leap of faith and started uploading once I met the big homie day and he was also looking to start putting his content out there for the world before that I was too afraid I didn't have the courage to do it on my own like humans are weak bro you're always going to find another reason to procrastinate and put off facing your fear and that means you're never ever going to change your financial situation or you're dating situation or your body so you surround yourself with like-minded men or working towards those same outcomes and that is literally why I created Beast Nation Beast Nation allows you to instantly tap into a tribe of like-minded men who are all pushing each other and working together to keep leveling up he literally accelerated I even met my newest business partner who won my team

you're red pills your focusing on yourself King you're just stackplay your cash up you're getting jacked you're not worried about women women are fucking distraction once you level up there's going to come to you anyway right okay so imagine this you have 10 million in your bank account you have a shredded six pack and you still have not put yourself out there with women yet you're still waiting for them to come to you guess what bro if you're still not able to make the move on the girl confidently start the conversation ask her out and leave things forward all that fucking money in your bank account it's not going to do it for you the female's are still not going to make the move on you you still have to learn how to do that like bro I worked on my dating life before I had any money before I had any clouds and I do not regret it since it was a crucial part of My Success is it taught me to face failure and rejection like a fucking and guess what else had some amazing experiences and relationships with girls back then some memories that that I'm not going to forget it was enjoyable to number seven contribution breaks the curse of speaking of women let me ask you a question right now if you're dating life is not at the level do you want it to be do you think that a you should just think about how bad it is and complain about it and maybe watch some YouTube videos about it see put it off and see you feel ready cuz I did all three of these things for Years bro and nothing changed that was just miserably alone and single and really aware of the fact that I couldn't get girls things only started to improve when I started to actually start conversations with women and then actually asked them if they wanted to hang out and actually set up the date I was actually swiping on dating apps contribution breaks the curse whatever thing you feel like right now is this big problem this big curse howcan you contribute to it more and more and more if financially your broke right now what more can you do can you get a second job can you start a side hustle can you take a course online to learn a programming language so you have a new skill to get a better job can you talk to your boss and ask him what needs to be done so you can get the next promotion in the next raise all of these are viable options what more can you do stop focusing on the fucking curse and start focusing more on how you can contribute more number eight women are just the icing I used to always believe I used to always know that once I had a girl friends then my life would be so much better because I have someone to come home with and spend time with and have sex with and kiss and go out on dates with and you know go to the corner store with just be so amazing to share my life with someone else and I was wrong about that if you picture your life being this cake you know the Main Ingredients the eggs the butter the flower those things are your career your Fitness routine your habits your mindset women and your relationships with women they are literally just the icing the nice pretty design on the top of the cake I don't need a woman in my life to be happy I can still wake up go to the gym grind on my businesses hang out with some friends watch the little Netflix to end the day and that's fucking awesome Yes I'm a married man now and I fully acknowledge that the right woman can add value to your life but it's just the icing on the cake don't make it the main ingredient number 9 I almost had a fingers failure is not failure so my biggest failure in my dating life was probably my first girlfriends you know after losing my virginity at 21 years old and getting my first girlfriend like 24 years oldthe year she broke up with me and I was I was devastated I feel like the only girl who who ever loved me was gone and that only happened once in 24 years like what was the likelihood of that happening again and it wasn't going to happen again that's a big failure right one of my biggest Financial failures was investing you know upwards of a million dollars into the stock market towards the end of 2021 right when it had a peek then before it drops like 25% that hurt that was a lot of numbers in my bank account that went down so the interesting thing about these failures is that they were not failures at all they were actually catalysts for some of the biggest growth periods in my entire life after losing that first girlfriend and having that validation that love stripped away from me it was a painful fire but I'll let this fire under my ass to make sure that there was no longer luck that I have another girl in my life I put my head down and got to work that's just before this YouTube channel took the fuck off before I got in the best shape of my life after I lost all that money in the stock market well I had to completely reevaluate how I was investing and I knew about dollar cost averaging but now I knew about dollar cost averaging and I was never going to make that mistake again the only failure in life is not trying in the first place if you're waiting on the sidelines now waiting for the right moment to hop in your failing that's a failure putting yourself out there going for it with your dating life going forward with your side hustle for your career and falling in your face that's not failure that's gross number 10 officially out of fingers testosterone is the daddy all of you know that to stop throwing is the key male hormone this responsible for us being able to build muscle and lose fat and have a sex drive and feel motivated and have energy when we don't have a healthy level of testosterone we feel like shit and we move like shitand that is why it is critical to do everything in your power to optimize your testosterone levels and the number one biggest thing that you can do is boring as this is is to optimize your sleep they've done studies that show off your sleep deprived or just a few days your T levels can drop by 15% so if you're not getting 8 hours of quality sleep per night what's the fuck are you doing bro the simplest hack is just to go to bed earlier if you're waking up at 7 a.m. every day you can't go to bed at 1 a.m. it doesn't the math doesn't fucking add up you're screwing yourself now of course diets and supplementation can also make a big impact and that is why we developed this green plus testosterone powder it's a daily green powder with a bunch of organic Greens in there which is just amazing for your overall health but it also has ashwagandha Ali extract which of the two most popular compounds the booster levels it's just a no-brainer supplement for men if you're interested in trying it out I'll throw a discount code on the screen the link in description to get your Greens Plus test today number 113 if you have more money that's going to make you a lot more attractive to women but that can take some years to build up obviously building muscle and shredding down that can make you a lot more attractive but again that's going to take you to three years to get there that being said there's two things that you can do literally today in the next couple of hours that can make you go from you know a six to eight easy number one is optimizing your hairstyle and the past I've had different haircuts that definitely didn't match my face shape and my type of hair and that made me uglier objectively so what I'd recommend doing is taking a look at Google Maps for barbers in your area and thenscroll through the reviews and the photos until you find one who not only has good reviews but you can tell from the photos that he's actually an expert Level Barber who can manage a variety of different hairstyles he doesn't just give you like the copy and paste fade the make an appointment and go talk to him and see what he recommends like my current hairstyle I'm not saying it's it's amazing but it's a lot better than it used to be and I didn't think of this Barbara recommended it and number two updates your wardrobe I'm no style Guru but I understand that getting clothes that fit my body well not too bad you not too tight and just have simple neutral color patterns that is a Timeless classic masculine look like throughout the ship that doesn't look that good if you're in some selfies in the Discord community and I can give you feedback myself and then select a few versatile pants and t-shirts so you look good when you go outside number 12 ego is the enemy so I've realized that in the past basically all the weakness that I had and all the bad decisions I made were because of my ego we tend to get so obsessed with this image in this idea of who we are and we don't want there to be any chinks in our armor we don't want there to be any weaknesses that other people can see that's why for years I was afraid to go on YouTube because I thought other people are going to judge me for it that's probably why you're still not out there approaching girls because if a girl rejects you now in your head you have to come to terms with this this concept this idea that maybe I'm not attractive to girls and it's more comfortable just not even to confront that and to maintain the safe you know safe image in your head that you're still this top gee when really you ain't shit like the end of the day we're all humans we're all Imperfects we're all flawed no one's figured it out if someone's pretending like they figured it out while they're just fucking pretending I don'tcall the answers bro these are just laws that I've learned from all this stupid things that I've done you must separate yourself from your ego you have to be okay with knowing that a girl's not interested in you because you're too short because you don't have enough money because you're just not her type you have to be okay with that you have to be okay you know putting yourself out there on the internet if that's something you want to do and know that there's going to be 20,000 people who think you're a complete loser I just know that when I started focusing on the actions that I'm taking and the things I'm building instead of how other people perceive me everything started going in my direction man number 13 fuck yes or no question for those who have a girl friends right now is that relationship is it adding to your life or is it subtracting to your life because maybe you have sex and that's great but maybe she broke her that you all day and that's not so great maybe you guys get to watch movies together at night and that's great but maybe she has some toxic traits that constantly give you anxiety and you're always worried about the relationship and worried that maybe she's going to break up with you if it is not a clear woo what do you doing bro what are you talking about the cake you have an amazing cake on your own why are you going to take some icing that's expired and starting to wrote the rest of the cake that otherwise would have been perfectly good I get the being alone is scary my second girlfriend it was a toxic relationship that I stayed in for way too long cuz I didn't want to be single you have to be strong bro and you have to be honest with yourself if you're dating a girl and it's not a fucking yes that is a know if it's not clearly adding value to your life and making things easier for you you know what to do number 14 saying no is actually sayingyes so tell me if you can relate to the situation it's Friday about 5:00 p.m. you're at the gym getting your Lyft in excited to go home have a big dinner wine down for the night so you're ready to crush the weekend after your goals then you get a text from your buddy and he says hey bro you want to come out with us tonight maybe they're going to the bars maybe they're going to a party and deep down you don't really want to go because you know then you're going to sacrifice how you feel the next morning cuz you're probably going to drink not get enough sleep but then there's this phone mobile because what if there's a cute girl you could talk to and all so like I don't want to say no to my friends if I could hang out with my friends that doesn't feel right you have to realize is that sometimes by saying yes to other people that means that you're saying no to working on your goals because you're allocating time that you should be working on your side hustle or your Fitness grind or whatever it is and instead of doing that you just doing something to make someone else happy and even beyond that in order to grow this YouTube channel the 1.6 million subscribers at first I had to say no to do in a podcast I had to say no to work on my Instagram because those were other projects that we're going to take away from my main priority which was YouTube saying no is a powerful weapon and a lot of times by saying no to these side quests or these fun social opportunities really what you're doing is saying yes to your main goal number 15 failing to play question for you what are three things that you need to get done today in order to move things to the next level in your life and if you're not really sure off the top of your head you can't quickly look at your phone no then you're already fucked you've already lost like the human brain is not it's not that effective bro if you're just relying on yourself to think of the right thing to do when the time comes or to rememberyou're the right thing at the right moment it's not going to happen it's that's not that's not how it works like we're constantly searching for excuses to be lazy and watch some more YouTube videos instead of getting to work or jerking off the porn instead of going to the gym your brain will always be searching for the next dopamine it now a bare minimum to avoiding this and they're giving yourself some structure is to make a list on your phone of the next action steps do you need to complete like every morning I wake up I don't think I just look at my phone and I start operating I know it needs to be done and if during the day I think of something that oh shit I got to make sure I do that at some point even if it's as simple as you know contacting the pool builders about something something basic I write it down on that list of things to do and it doesn't get forgot and it always gets done and that's how I always move things forward and those are the 15 laws of self improvements if you're serious about getting to that next level in life and you need to watch this video next it's about why your insecurities are
