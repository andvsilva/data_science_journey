look I got into self-improvement 10 years ago I'm 33 now I was 23 and at that time I was in awkward kid with the low self-confidence low self-esteem I could barely even like hold I contact with an attractive girl I'm not saying I've become the most successful man in the world I know plenty of guys who are further along in their self improvement Journey than I am but the progress that I've made is undeniable and during these last ten years I've experimented with countless difference habits because habits are the things the actions that we take every single day and by definition they literally crapped us into the man that we become so what we're going to do in this video is dive into some popular self improvement habits you've probably heard of and they're going to talk about some other habits you've definitely not heard over and it's very important that you listen to all of the habits because at the end I'm going to assign each of them a ranking depending where you are right now on your journey some of these are going to be absolutely critical to help you get to that next level or is other ones you're going to want to avoid at all costs so let's dive in first habit is no fat so I was not regularly sexually active until I was probably like 24 years old and before that I definitely watched my fair share of porn and it's funny because like when I was a teenager at first I could get around just by looking at like photos of a bikini model in a magazine like not even naked and then the internet came along and then it was maybe nude photos and then it was actual porn scenes and then before you know it's multiple tabs of multiple different scenes at the same time and that's why this shit is so dangerous because it literally reprograms our minds to need more and more stimulation in order to get aroused and in order to achieve that dopamine hit that we get when we finallyerectile dysfunction because of it and on the other hand it completely destroyed my motivation to actually go out and meet real women and for these reasons no fat is a tier 3 habit if you don't have a lot of experience with women then no fat can change your life but if you're someone who's sexually active or you have a girlfriend and you're not addicted to it it's not something you feel like you need to do every single day well watching porn once every couple weeks is not going to kill you the next habit is sleeping look one study showed that when they took a group of men increased their sleep for just one week they're testosterone levels had dropped by 10 to 15% not getting quality sleep literally kills our testosterone and just remove our masculine Vigor and energy from us like if you're tired all the time you're probably going to make less money be less confident and outgoing opportunities and just live a worse life now it's like millions of different sleep hacks out there so really quickly as when a breakdown the top five they've been most effective for me number one is having a fan pointed directly at my body when I feel that air flow over my body I stay cooler and I sleep deeper number two was wearing socks seems kind of odd but I've read a lot of data that suggests that this can actually improve your circulation and then as a result keep your body temperature lower number three blackout curtains are not sure about you but as soon as like a little Ray of sun comes through my window I'm going to wake up even if I went to sleep two hours early my body's like yo it's time to go if you don't have them you can get them pretty cheap on Amazon or for some reason that's not going to work you're not going to be able to install them just get a sleep mask and it's going to basically achieve the same thing number four is melatonin I've seen conflicting reports on this and like maybe you shouldn't get dependents on it so what I do is just whenever I go through a period of like two or three days where I'm not sleeping great then I'll Take FiveGraham's melatonin before bed for the next 2 or 3 days maybe it's a placebo but it helps me get back into that good sleep Rhythm sleep hacking is going to go to the top tier the god to your baby this is absolutely non-negotiable for every man all right next habit is affirmations so back like the old school days of self-help this was super popular telling yourself these positive things and then that would make it true I am a strong confident successful attractive man women everywhere desire me and want me to take them to my bedroom like this idea that if you keep telling yourself this shit that your subconscious mind is just going to accept it and then it's got to be true you're going to become that man bro you can become that dude man and look maybe there's some truth to it but the only affirm that I ever use that was impactful was this affirmation that came from this book called love yourself like your life depends on it by tomorrow he's borderline suicidal he doesn't even want to leave his bed in what changes his life is looking himself in the mirror and using this affirmation of I love myself he would look in the mirror and tell himself I love myself I love myself and at first because he didn't believe it would literally bring him to tears and I actually went through the same experience after I read the book and started doing this myself if you get in the habit of looking in that damn mirror and doing this whenever you're in a week mental place I promise you it will change how you feel about yourself this is going to be a tier 2 habit highly effective of every man should do this the next habit is the cold approach so back in the old pickup artist today is the cold approach or the act of approaching a girl randomly who you don't know this was like considered what measured you as a man not as I mentioned I had zero confidence with women sothis is something that I told myself I have to do and I went through a period where I compulsively did this or I would literally pull over my car park it get out and approach attractive girl if I happen to pass her on the sidewalk and while I definitely do not recommend that you do that I would recommend that you approach at least one girl every single day if right now you're in a place where you cannot confidently speak to an attractive woman and the purpose of this is not to meet a bunch of girls and get a bunch of days or girlfriends the purpose is to sharpen your sword it is literally to get out of your comfort zone and face that fear of failure and rejection that's preventing you from pursuing girls in more organic situations and for this reason it's a tier 3 habit situationally this is good to do if you need it not time out quick because something that's not exactly a habit but definitely should be non-negotiable for every man to do is to level up your damn stop in an area where most men are severely lacking is there shooting game but for all of us today's video is sponsored by Bruno Mars so

with Bruno Mars so this next habit my take on this my trigger some people it's waking up early you know a lot of these Jocko willink David Goggins type of respect for I'm just trying to illustrate a certain type of guy they swear that if you just wake up 4:30 a.m. it's going to completely change your mindset bro and turn you into a machine and I get it the idea is you're up before other people you can work uninterrupted and it's like you're actively taking control of your life instead of staying up late and jerking off or something and by the way I do think that like the first three or four hours of the day are always going to be our most productive where we can just stay really focused power hasn't been depleted yet but for my experience it doesn't matter if I wake up at 9 a.m. and my first three hours are from 9 a.m. to 12 p.m. versus if I wake up at 4:00 a.m. in my first three hours are from 4 a.m. to 7 a.m. either way I'm getting shit done for me this is a tier 4 habitat wake up when you want figure out the time today most productive day today next meditation so I feel like meditation was like really trendy a few years ago and now it's little bit out of fashion like I'm not going to sit there for 10 minutes every day you think about nothing bro from my experience is someone who used to be extremely anxious and you used to be very susceptible to falling into like negative thought patterns where I would start to second guess decisions I made or doubt my ability to do things meditation change my life I used to use the headspace app and I had a streak one time of overfear of meditating back-to-back days 10 minutes every single day and I think the value of meditation is that it allowed me to completely Master my breath work where now when I get into a bad head space or into an intimidating situation I'm able to very effectively breathe and I can tell you or someone else can tell you you know breathe work is crucial you got to know that breathing deeply to your belly exhale and let every muscle fiber relax but until you've gone through like extensive meditation where you're only focuses your breath you don't truly Master it so meditation is going to be a tier 3 habit situationally it's good to do if you're someone with lower confidence hiring not negotiable you got to do it positive visualization is the next happened so kind of like affirmations this used to be an old school self-help trick where it's just close your eyes and picture yourself you know walking across that stage and accepting your company close your eyes and picture that attractive girl sitting across from you on the date and laughing and play making eye contact with you hoping that you invite her back to your bedroom and again I'm not going to completely shit on this because I do think that maybe you can help you make yourself more prepared for the situation and make yourself realize hey this is actually could happen but it's a little bit it's a little bit sketchy don't put this in tear for me but by all means experiment on your own trying to do this maybe it's more impactful to your situation next is the OG cold showers so if you're familiar with my videos you know that I take cold showers every fucking day no matter what and every day I hate it I wake up I turn that cold water onI doubt it I look at myself in the mirror and say hey David stop being such a bitch and then I walk into that cold shower and then there's never that bad I was actually doing it it's never that bad and that's kind of the whole point here like sure they have done actual studies that show that it releases neurotransmitters in your brain that can actually be used as an effective therapy against depression like when you walk out you get this dopamine it and you actually feel happier but the main reason that I do it is because it trains my brain not to be soft periodbeing proud of the things that I've done and that's positive reinforcement that makes us more likely to do that again in the future and then rather than beating myself up about the things that I didn't do well I have a forward-thinking mindset where I'm like hey it's no big deal because next time I'm in that situation I'm a nail that shit right it's simple it's effective is Category 2 I think every dude who's trying to level up their life should absolutely do this next is gratitude and this is the idea of every morning you wake up and you think of three things that you're grateful for for example I'm grateful that I have a roof over my head and I'm not homeless I'm grateful that I have parents who support me you know no matter what I chose to do with my life I am grateful that over the past three months I've been able to stay consistent in the gym and make some games what does us to contemplate the things that we have rather than the things that we don't have which for being honest I think normally a lot of times when you wake up and be like damn it I'm still not at the body fat percentage I want I still haven't made as much money as I want yet that girl goes to me I'm not going to be able to get that girl and then we put ourselves in a mindset of lacking and of scarcity rather than a mindset of abundance and feeling like you know my life is dope as it is bro if I can make it better that's awesome but it's already dope butts and practice I'm giving this category four I think if you're in a dark place this is worth doing to get a little momentum but I have personally not seen any positive impacts on my life when I did this for an extended period of time the productivity system that's the next have it so this is something that I've seen some guys go like really deep on and really geek out on having multiple notion tables and multiple Excel spreadsheets and vision board and a Blackboard and a whiteboard and a purple board a perfectly keep track of all of their differentwhen does it have to be done and like come on bro if you get to the point where your prioritizing your priority system over the actual action that you're taking well now you're going to take less action and it's like cool you got a cool productivity system what's the fucking point at the same time if you have no productivity system and you have nothing to keep track of what you need to get done well then you're going to wake up and like do the things do you feel like doing but those might not be the most important High leverage activities that you need to do and your progress is going to be limited so what I like to do is an extremely simple system that you can copy from me I just have a notepad app on my MacBook and my phone I just write down the next action step I need to take for each of the projects that I'm working on so for example maybe I need to plan my next YouTube video that I'm going to put that down brainstorm next YouTube video of a Verdi brainstorm and delete that and put the next step next YouTube video don't delete that edit next YouTube video you know book our flights from our next vacation to France the point is I wake up take a look at this and then dive into my most important activities without wasting any time and if something ever randomly pops into my head will I know exactly where to put it and then it's waiting for me when I have time to get that done this is tier one God tier if you don't have a basic system like this you're fucked and then we got reading so I know you're watching a YouTube video now maybe listen to some podcast after that but before all of this technology we had these things called books bro and I think if we're being honest not just a lot more accessible now that we have all these different means of media box I will say that in the past when I had to literally sit there with a physical book turn it Page by Page rage paragraph by paragraph there be times where I can put the book down and I'll just sit there in silence and contemplate you know how I was going to implement this thing in my life or contemplate what this this paragraph of this chapterhabit situationally it's good to do if there's something specific in your life you're not happy with and you really want to work on I'd recommend reading a book about it is that's going to go deep into it and it's really going to make you actually contemplate how you're going to fix your life how you're going to change that thing I'll go ahead and drop a link in the description to the top self-improvement books that have changed in my life and had a huge impact on my life if you enjoyed this video I recommend you watch this one next it is about six strategic ways
