if you are an introvert and you do not make these changes number one introverts does not equal so I've always been a more shy person and I've never really enjoyed going to Big social events whether it's a party whether it's going out to a bar nightclub or even like a big family events whenever I'm at any of these things I'm just thinking like when is this shit going to be over so I can go home and do something by myself you know get some work done grind or maybe hang out with a few close friends in a more intimate setting am I alone here am I crazy or are some of the same page now the funny thing not really funny but the sad thing is that I always looked at that as this big weakness like I just suck I'm never going to be confident I'm always going to be overpowered by these extra that is simply not true it's just a week Story We Tell ourselves so weak excuse to let ourselves off of the hookbecause if there's something wrong with us well now it's not even worth trying to put ourselves out there because we're going to fuck it up anyway we're just a weak introvert the reality is we just have to play the game by a different set of rules and we have to follow a slightly different path to get to that end result but being an introvert once you understand how to take advantage of it it's actually a superpower number two micro disagreements the easiest way to sabotage your own life and almost every introvert does this is to always take a passive role in conversations like it's really easy to fall into this mindset that we're just being bullied and conversations we need to just accept it and take it or change the conversation or remove ourself from the conversation to avoid that pain and it's bullshit you just gotta change the game plan you got to change the frame and luckily this doesn't need to be done by being the loudest of the most aggressive person in the room and the simplest way to pull this off is by using micro disagreements on the past if I was talking to someone when we got election season coming up in the United States and they were expressing their views politically and maybe they didn't align with minelet's just change the subject or politely agree with them now instead I actually look at these things as opportunities to build a stronger conversational frame so if someone was to say I can't believe Donald Trump is going to get the Republican nomination again man he's despicable old David would be like yeah he's pretty bad I hope not I hope he doesn't get it now I might say it's interesting that you see it that way I actually think he might be a better option than Biden and then I'll just leave it like that and see how they respond and I'm not even trying to get into a discussion or to prove them wrong here that is not the fucking points the points is just to let people know from time to time that you don't agree with them because here's the thing when someone else does this to you from time to time you understand on a deep level that that person is not a pushover you can't just talk shit to them and expect them to take it you can't walk all over him it's not going to happen and this is all so extremely crucial when you're talking to a girl that you like probably stay away from the politics in that case at leastfirst but maybe she says yeah I actually you know hate Boston I'm much more enjoy living in NYC now maybe you're from Boston you could be like really I love boss I'm actually from Boston how come you think that you're not being butthurt you're not trying to prove her wrong you're just having a micro disagreement and establishing a stronger frame number three divide and conquer so back in University I was on the Boston University snowboarding team there's probably 30 or 40 people on the team it was like 10 or 15 smoking hot girls that I wish that I could have dated back then but I had no chance because when I was in that group environments I felt like a loser I was always like on the outside of the group I was never the center of attention and I was always so jealous of the guys who would just effortlessly be telling a story to like 15 people at once they were all laughing while I'm over on the outside of the circle like this guy you know what I'm talking about what is one group lately that you've been part of the you wish you could be the alpha male and maybe it's just a big finger with you hang out with sometimes maybe you go to salsa dancing lessons once per week and it's always the sameit's the same basic crew of people and you wish you know you could be like the leader so in this scenarios this is all I do I divide and conquer when I walk in I'm going to find someone who's not currently engaged in a big group and I'm just going to meet them one-on-one super basic conversation for two or three minutes you know hey how's it going what's your name bro I'm David where are you from and how did you become part of this group oh interesting well look it was nice to meet you I'll see you around man same thing for guys and girls casual quick conversations because now once I've been in this environment two or three times I'm already going to know like 10 15 people one-on-one so as I'm walking in the door and now it's like hey Sally how's your week going hey James what's up with you today and I just immediately feel comfortable and confidence without having had to do some extra virgin myself I know that dating can be like the most painful part of our life because it can just seem so intimidating to try and approach a girltalking to a girl we find attractive it can seem impossible to think of the right thing to say next so if that's something you're struggling with I just want to let you know that I am here to help with my privates Beast dating coaching

time completely alone away from other people you know maybe you're grinding away working on some projects or something how do you feel well I know for myself and I think this is true for most introverts I can fucking Crush time alone I enjoy it I get lost in whatever I'm doing and I don't need likeagainst contact with other people in order to stay focused and you might not realize this but not everyone has this ability there's a lot of extroverts that I've worked with in the past but they've been partners of mine or employees that work for me and if they're not getting constant like feedback and approval from other people and they're not constantly able to have social interactions they lose their fucking mind and if you're in your twenties or thirties right now and you're trying to keep your head down and fucking build something of your life this is a superpower bro like y'all know we just dropped the bees Nation a few weeks ago that took months of myself working in silence in darkness all alone building up this YouTube channel to 1.5 million subscribers again wouldn't have been possible if I wasn't able to just lock myself up and keep my head down the point is for guys like me and you yeah when it comes to social situations we may have to put in a little bit of extra effort and work when it comes to our career and grinding it's easier for us number five Bond James Bonds so if you close your eyes for a second and picture Hollywood movie scenes of a man ever listened to sleep picking upwoman in spitting game what do you think of most of us are going to think of like Ryan Gosling doing some dance moves talking some shit bringing her home or something like that usually it's an extroverted guy right well for us guys who tend to be a little bit quieter James Bond he is your dating Avatar he is the type of game that you should aim to have and obviously he's cool as fuck he's got money he's got style he's got a nice body if you don't have them yet not an excuse keep your head down keep fucking working but the way that he doesn't say too many words he sits back and allows the girl to talk to him and to prove herself to him that's your mindset you have to close your eyes and envision that your James Bond before you go on your next date I don't know my son silly my feel a bit weird but watch a few James Bond movies again if you haven't seen them recently and really get into that type of energy that's that Boston number six words silence do you know when you're talking to a girl that you really like maybe you're out on a date with her maybe you just approached her at the gym and then for a second you can't think of what to say next and then insidemute your head starts to start to go a little bit crazy and it starts to go into overdrive and then it's even harder to think of what to say next and you start thinking fuck I lost this now I'm going to say something stupid fuck I need to say something now this is getting worse this is getting worse yeah it's not it's not fun we've all been there I've been there it's not fun I don't want to go back there I used to dread these awkward silences so much but what I've realized is that if you're like me you have to learn to use them to your advantage because you're never going to be able to avoid them you're introvert brain doesn't work that way we're not fire always thinking of the perfect thing to respond back to people that's not how we work like I got the game playing for you right here and it's an easy one to execute and those moments all you have to do is take a deep breath like actually maybe pull yourself away a little bit post relief from the girls so you're leans a little bit more back hold on I contact with her and wait and see how she reacts and what you'll see is that 9 out of 10 times the girl will be the one who feels the silence she'll see howso you are with the silence and she'll understand I was actually my responsibility now to think of what to say next and if she doesn't it's almost even better because you're going to have this really intense eye contact for 5 or 10 seconds again sitting back feeling confident maybe a little grin on your face and the sexual tension is going to go through the roof and also what you realize now that you have a game plan for how to deal with these moments and immediately you calm your body down and adjust your posture your naturally start to think of cool things to say because there's no pressure on you anymore number seven the voice in your head so we're talking about the voice in your head and the inner dialogue that goes on inside of your minds how would you describe it generally is it positive thoughts and feedback or is it negative thoughts on feedback bro for most of my life mine was it wasn't just like a little bit negative it was like someone was trying to constantly tell me that I was wrong that I was on the wrongwhat I was going to do wasn't going to work and that I was just fucked I'll be like in the gym and I'd spot an attractive girl in The Voice would be like no chance bro look how Jack that other guys over there how you going to reproach her she's probably looking at him and what the what are you going to say what are you going to talk to this girl you got nothing to say you got no chance maybe yours is not not as intense as mine I'm not sure but maybe it is maybe he's even more intense even though I'm not sure how that would be possible the point is that you need to start to dissociate from this voice inside of your head there's you there's your being and then there's this stupid little voice is not the same thing and when the voice starts going you have to realize that you actually have power over the voice and you can say no I'm not going to go down that path I'm not going to think about that I know that in these scenarios I'll have to do is actually start physically walking towards the girl and tell her a simple statement or question you know hey I see you working out here the same time as me every day I wanted to come and say hi my name is David what's your name whatever it might be this should always follows the same pattern your facing some intimidating situationturn the voice starts and that's when you have to step in and be the big boss man and tell that voice shut up you little bitch this is not your time we're in operated mode right now seriously say that to yourself inside of your head and now you're going to have two competing voices but you're going to give more power to the boss voice and it's going to dominate The Bitch voice if this is something you really struggle with I would highly recommend doing daily meditations this is the Calm app I use this for like a year straight I don't consistently meditating anymore but doing that for years straight it forces you to get comfortable and to fully understands and be present with this shity voice and actually practice meditation is how you practice putting it back in its place now if you need to be a little bit more quiet and shy and you're working to level up your dating life then you need to watch this video next it is about how to get a hot woman obsessed with
