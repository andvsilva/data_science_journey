so look there are three types of men in this world the first one is the nice guy and regrettably this is who I was for most of my teens in twenties I was friendly I was respectful to other people and I thought that made me a good person but the reality is that I was afraid I was afraid of conflict I was afraid of doing anything that might make someone else not like me and of course that was devastating for my dating life because I couldn't take risks with girls so if this is where you are you need to move forward as fast as possible so you stop missing out and opportunities or get him friend zone the second man is the fake Alpha and his frustrating because a lot of times this is the guy who steals your girl and you're like man what would you choose him he's such a asshole I'd be so much better for her but you also don't want to be this guy because really it's just someone who struggles to control their emotions they get frustrated and they lash out at other people it's the same guy who was driving his car he gets road rage and he's yelling at other people or he gets drunk and he gets aggressive yes it can work with women some women at least because it kind of like fake signals that he has confidence and that he can be a protector and provider but it's really only going to work with women who are very young and naive or women who have low self-esteem or I used to be treated like shit not not the top quality girls did you actually want to build a relationship with now the third type of man is the one who is capable of violence and what makes him different is that he can face conflicts in a calm calculated way and this allows him to get the hottest girls because he can go after what he wants he can create that sexual spark but he can also set boundaries in the relationship before and away that allows it to growstay stable and these type of guys also tend to be the most financially successful because they're able to take those calculated risks and not let their emotions take control of them ever and that is why in this video we're going to take a look at the five things I had to do to kill my inner nice guy and become this type of man not to be this

when I was working as a personal trainer next to my gym there was a Lululemon store and there was a super hot blonde girl that works in that store and I told myself I'm going to ask her out like it's not even a question I'm going to ask her out bro I just got to wait to the next opportunity I have so you know after work I got stroll through the store but she be talking to a customer so I dip out or she'd be in the gym working out but there'd be like you know a few too many people close to her that might overhear the conversation so I wait for the next time and it's the super weak bulshit that I used to do I would always leave this gray area this wiggle room for myself rather than saying I'm going to ask her out next time I see her I would ask her out the next time that I have an opportunity and the funny thing is by the time I worked up the courage to ask her out she had a boyfriends and I miss my chance what I've changed since then is that now I seek out these gray areas in my life and when I find them I just destroy them next time I see her I'm going to ask her out even if I have to wait for her to finish dealing with a customer or five to do it with some other people in the gym nearby and a lot of times this has to do with saying no to people for example when I go out if my friends are drinking I'll have one or two drinks but it doesn't matter what they say after that no I'm not drinking more I'm going to feel like shit tomorrow or I'd be texting a girl trying to set up the first date and she died hey is it cool if my friend comes along she's in town no I don't want your friend to come out on the date no I don't want to keep texting you for not going to meet up in person know it's not cool with my girlfriend is going on a girls trip to Miami no I'm not okayI'm in a relationship where there's no sex or spark anymore no I'm not okay with it if a girl I'm dating starts to prioritize our friends in her career above our relationship you cannot leave any gray room with these decisions or you're going to rationalize the weaker decision every time as you experience new things in life you have to decide and understand what is a no and what's a yes and you cannot compromise on those things otherwise you will always stay the nice guy and other people they're not going to respect you because they'll know they can just bully you into staying in whatever situation they want to keep you with number two you got to be able to break past being friendly from time to time now there's a massive difference between deciding to say no to someone versus actually following through and telling them know you might be watching this video right now hyped up like fuck yeah David I would never tolerate that shit from a girl but then the situation happens and it's going to test your resolve your texting a girl you ask her if she wants to hang out she says no I'm busy this week so you try again next week you say do you want to hang out and then she doesn't respond for a day and she responds the day later and says haha how's your week going she doesn't even answer the question about wanting to hang out what do you do you know it should be an automatic know if you ask a girl to hang out twice and she flakes or ignores the question but she texted you back and she's hot so maybe maybe this time I don't say no maybe I give it one more shot for this girl ready for three ways that I practice conflict in my everyday life so when these situations come up I can approach them with confidence and I can tell people no number one do not explain decisions so maybeplay buddy of mine text me and says hey bro tomorrow can you help me move this furniture and maybe tomorrow I'm really busy but I feel bad saying no and I want to be like well my girls not feeling well so I can't make it there no do not explain instead I practice by just saying no tomorrow I cannot do that unfortunately or maybe I got a date scheduled and the girl hits me up the day before and says hey can we actually meet closer to my place I'm going to say no let's stick with the plan no explanation not only is this good practice but also with girls in the early stages man you give him an hour she's going to continue to walk all over your ass after that number to challenge people this is one of my favorite things to do socially because no one ever does it and it's actually fun but when someone says something you don't agree with so for example a lot of guys and Beast Nation recently been telling me when they're showing up to date or messaging with girls a lot of girls right now were like I can't believe the United States is going to be it's going to be helpful for the next four years the democracy is gone well you know I think that's a ridiculous claim so I would say really why do you think that what makes you believe that and I would just sit back and observe people are not used to being challenged because usually you'll just like let it go and not address it or you might get a bit of emotional and be like fuck that bitch what would you say that and I don't just do this with politics maybe someone's talking about how Kanye West is crazy and I think Kanye West I know Kanye West is the goat the greatest musician of all time I would ask him really you don't like Kanye why not the key is to do it in a very neuthow old is curious tone but this is the best practice for conflict really and the points not even to prove them wrong or to get in a disagreement it's just to practice the conflict and after they respond I might just say oh you know I disagree but that's an interesting perspective and number three this is the most difficult one confronts disrespect immediately if someone blatantly disrespects you even though you don't want to cause a scene or you don't think things to escalate as a man you must confront that disrespect so for example earlier this year I was on a flight with Julia from Germany back to Spain this one we were living in Marbella and I had paid for us to sit in the front row it wasn't a business class this flight didn't have business but there was more leg room so I was set by the window Julia in the middle and in the I'll see was open so a guy gets on with his daughter and this is his seat next to us and he looks at us and he says Hey can my daughter take your seats because she gets nervous when she flies and I was like this guy just like assumed and set it in the most presumptive way that he would just give up our seats that he knows very well because he paid for that seat too and on top of that if you really want your daughter to sit in the front can you switch seats with her so I took it as disrespect I looked up at him and I said no we chose these seats and I looked back forward and I said it in a bit of aggressive home because afterwards Julie was like oh man he didn't have to like escalate things but the interesting thing is it did not escalate because when you confront the disrespect immediately before it goes on it tends to squash things right there I promise bro if you lookopportunities to practice these three things in your daily life approaching conflict and setting boundaries is going to feel so much easier number three identify your fist of control so question for you right now what do you have going on in your life that requires absolutely no help or approval or assistance from anybody else so for me even if all my friends abandons me and Julia left my ass I would still have the gym to go and work on my body and experience growth there I would still have this YouTube Channel videos create new content and try to experience growth there but for you what you have going on that you can work on and grow regardless of anyone else drop a comment below right now because this is your fist of control and this should give you Peace of Minds that even if everyone abandons you and no girl ever shows you any attention you still have a life you still have have something to focus on you still have something to dedicate yourself to and that gives me intense of mine because I don't have to rely on anyone else I don't have to rely on women giving me approval yes will be devastating if my wife left me that was suck but I want to be the end of the world I got plenty of other shit that I can keep my head down on but if you're still in the nice guy face likely what you'll find is that you don't have anything going on in your life and because of that you're latching to every opportunity you get with girls and you're hoping that that's where you're going to get your happiness and you're contentment from or maybe you do have things going on in your life but you have been aware of the Fist of control and now bring all of your attention to thosethanks those are things you can depend on but without that you'll continue to obsess over girls be afraid of rejection whenever they give you any attention you'll chase them and text them until you've sent them away without the fist of control you'll always feel and acts in a hopeless manner number for learn to fight so let's be very logical here you can never be a man who is capable of violence without having some experience of violence it's impossible you can't just hype yourself up into having this type of calm certainty that comes with knowing that hey if I walked out the door right now and someone tried to physically attack me at the very least like I've trained White House on and off for five years I haven't in the last year I haven't been active but at the very least I've faced those situations before and fights inspiring and I would have some idea of how I would defend myself and attack back with my fists with my knees with my legs if you have zero fighter experience you'll always have a bit of this fearful look in your eyes that's men and women will recognize this is not a guy who is confident this is not a guy who could protect me if the shit hit the fan and there's no other substitute other than getting some actual fighting experience so if that's you right now I'll just open up your phone and search for Brazilian Jiu Jitsu or white side or MMA gyms in your area and just going to give you a free class to make sure you like the vibe and sign up for weekly classes and ideally sign up with a location that actually allows for sparring so you're not just sitting there practicing technique and some cardio boxin class you can ask the experience getting punched in the face it's not a good experience but I'm glad I've experienced it many times number five realize that this is masculinity literally bro this is something you either going to figure out and you're going to adapt and you're going to become comfortable with conflict or you're not and you're going to continue to miss out on women and opportunities to men who are comfortable with conflicts and again we're not talking about being an asshole and searching for conflict but rather being able to put yourself in uncomfortable situations when it calls for being able to approach a girl when it calls for being able to set up boundary with the girl when it calls for being able to stand up for yourself when another man disrespects you these things don't happen you know 15 200 day but they are happening a few times a week and if you're slipping up and hiding from all of those opportunities well that's going to compounds week after week after month after year and you'll always feel like a feminine boy this is the difference between the masculine and feminine the mask in must be prepared to rise to the challenge of face the conflict when the opportunity comes and speaking of opportunities make sure you don't miss out on the edge Black Friday deals bro once they're gone they're gone that being said right now if you're able to talk to and even date no the sixes in the sevens the above average looking girls but not the nine in the twins do you need to watch this
