hello hello39 and after that I work for some baby companies out here so my last company that I work for was Lucent and then after that I started off on my own and for the past 2 years I've been trying to do this right now we're listening that I know of your companyall your calls into an MP3 file and then you can you can play it back you can search through your speakersyes and the reason that I found it interesting is that I'm not sure if you're aware of this fact that you your software called Grande seems to be the only one that can be used for free and with the with the functionality of a stereothe conversation into separate audio tracks so that would be a perfect choice for for podcast because we most of the time will bump into the situation that the two people have different volumes so it will be very very hard to to do the modification when you do the post-production to editaudacity is a good very good audio editor and you can export the tracks separately plus there is also a feature in which you can record the calls in a Wi-Fi so if you do record the calls in a refill then you don't lose any quality the quality is maintained of the car yes that provide the same functionality of separate tracksopen registration fee so it's a very very outstanding point from from my point of view I think you should you should emphasize to search through the internet about50,000 Google hits compared to other software maybe maybe several million hits one of the reason is that we released it recently so I'm just 2 months old and it got covered by a few popular with logs few popular blogs for example Lifehacker are covered us and download sport cover does but I guess it takes some time to split through the Google Google Netflixtell me the blocks advertising so if people mostly through Word of Mouth we are not we don't have any videos or means of doing advertising so that's that's one of the reasons yeah I have you know after I found yourselfthere are a few issues with it and that's why we need a lot of updates as well but hopefully it will go out of beta in another month or so yeah my laptoporiginal equipment manufacturers it's something like a personal need to be easy to explaincan you say that again so so the solution you are talking about now is is that theme song the product name is painful it's it was originally meant to be a Wi-Fi phone with a software on it but now what we have done is we are trying to market the software separately the software is basically consisting it consists of a server and a client the service or on the Internet and the client gives you access to all kinds of web services likeGoogleset it upplay Wi-Fi for the music so I'll be part of introducing this interruptible plan so that you don't have to you can actually talk to proprietary systems as well okay so so so so are you still going to have a hardware attached to to your software Google right now but maybe thewhat's the problem in this kind of OEM odm Manufacturing 51104how manyyou are not releasing anything using open source license but I assume that your company might use open source to to open source software to generate and some other stuff rightyeah I will be I'm a very big fan of Open Source I follow open source question markshut down so far for us for a for a startup like us it makes much more sense to go for a open source solution actually suppose for a hardware we needed we needed to put an artist so the real time always part so we actually we just without thinking we chose the next because it doesn't have any any cost associated with it I can actually I can control the source I can I can I have the sauce with me so I can modify at this point dynamics of softwareyes but you like I mention of like that you and I are both from from the Telecommunications industry so you work for I think you work for Tata consulting service before then you work for Lucerne right yeah that's good for almost 7 years and and my focus is on telecommunication too so muchthat familiar or enthusiastic about open source and so it's it's not that easy to find another guy here in Taiwan and also in the Telecommunications industry and also very and also very enthusiastic about open source how how is the situation in India in Bangalore open source code mailingTelecom industry open sources has not really taken a very big foot home but it's actually beginning to happen now for example you would find just because of the popularity of Linux on servers yes because of its performance
