## AI Sciences
### AI Experts & Data Scientists |4+ Rated | 160+ Countries
```bash
We are a group of experts, PhDs and Practitioners of Artificial Intelligence, 
Computer Science, Machine Learning, and Statistics. Some of us work in big 
companies like Amazon, Google, Facebook, Microsoft, KPMG, BCG, and IBM.

We decided to produce a series of courses mainly dedicated to beginners and 
newcomers on the techniques and methods of Machine Learning, Statistics, 
Artificial Intelligence, and Data Science.

Initially, our objective was to help only those who wish to understand these 
techniques more easily and to be able to start without too much theory and 
without a long reading. Today we also publish a more complete course on some 
topics for a wider audience.

Our courses have had phenomenal success. Our Courses have helped more 
than 100,000 students to master AI and Data Science.
