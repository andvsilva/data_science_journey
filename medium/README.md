# My Journey On Medium To Join The Partner Program Does Not End So Well

I start my journey on medium to write about topics related with programming in geral, because I like to work developing things to solve problems in real world.

To join the Partner Program Application is necessary to fill three requirements, according to the medium - [HERE](https://mediumpartnerprogram.typeform.com/apply?typeform-source=medium.com):

- **Have at least 100 followers**
- **Have published at least one story (not including responses) on Medium**
- **Be at least 18 years old**

I finally reach 100 followers and I already published 4 stories so far.

**BUT, I received a reply from**

**Because...**

Currently, enrollment in the Partner Program is only available in the following countries*:

Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hong Kong, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Mexico, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Singapore, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, United Kingdom, and the United States

*Please note: Outlying territories of supported countries are not supported at this time.

From this report above:

"To join the Medium Partner Program and start earning revenue based on member engagement, Medium requires you to create a Stripe account and link your bank account or debit card. You can learn more about joining the Partner Program here.

At this time, Stripe is the only payment processor for the Medium Partner Program. However, Stripe is still in the "preview" mode in India and Brazil.

What this means is that while Medium users can sign up for this preview mode while residing in India, it is still outside of Medium's payout region. **As such, please note that Medium is still unable to pay any revenue to users from India or Brazil.**"

Therefore, my country Brazil is not supported at this moment.

In my opinion, this problem does not make sense to me, because **medium** is a plataform online to writers to share knowlegde, thinking and expertise with the world without geographical limitations, known as ***borderless***, with the internet today, we have the decentralization of knowledge that allow people to access and empowering individuals.

Today(```2023-01-19```) we have so many solutions to transfer money online and so far this issue has not been resolved yet. From the posts published in **Medium Policy**:

I saw this comment that show the situation 5 years ago in 2018:

So far in 2023, we are still facing this issue. Both writes and the medium are losing talents around the world.

That's it for now. Thank you very much for read the article, I appreciate.
